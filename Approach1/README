# All link forming approach

## Features

1. Links are being formed between all entities that lie in the same sentence 

2. Scoring is done as the fraction of links that are present in wikidata/total links in each paragraph, not at a sentence level.

3. All special symbols are removed and 3 worded names are left in

## Problems 

1. Links are being formed btw objects which do not have direct links- 
Eg. Kabir is a maths student and an instrument player.  In this, if we make links between all pairs which lie in the same sentence, there will be a link from maths student to instrument player which would most definetly be present in the KG. 

2. Subjects are being wrongfully extracted and there is no way to figure out when that is happening 

3. As the scoring is done at a paragraph level, if most of the links being formed are correct and only 1 is incorrect, the score for that para is still high. 

4. Same issues as version 2 as well 

## Scores 

0.2 in incorect and 0.18 in correct
