Since October 23, 2012, after several weeks off the air, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks.

As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached the "New York Times" best seller list. Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as "fostering extremism or hatred". He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement, and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes. Since 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for allegedly "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred".
