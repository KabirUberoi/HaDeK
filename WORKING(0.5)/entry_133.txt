Ground Truth : 

Richard Michael "Kip" Carpenter (14 August 1929 26 February 2012) was an English television screenwriter, author, and actor who created a number of British television series, including "Robin of Sherwood" and "Catweazle". Born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, Carpenter attended the Old Vic Theatre School before starting an acting career by working in rep. He appeared in occasional films, but was mostly active on British TV in the 1960s as a character player, on one occasion opposite Tony Hancock in one of his last shows for the BBC, commonly known as "The Bowmans". Other TV shows in which he appeared in the 1960s included "Z-Cars", "Dixon of Dock Green", and "Gideon's Way". In 1969, Carpenter created "Catweazle", the children's series about an unfortunate wizard from the 11th century who is accidentally transported to the present day. This changed the course of his career substantially. Carpenter earned international recognition and a Writers Guild Award for creating the cult children's TV series. During the 1970s, he wrote the series "The Ghosts of Motley Hall" (1976 78), "Dick Turpin" (1979 82), parts of the series "The Famous Five" and "Doctor Snuggles", and seventeen episodes of "The Adventures of Black Beauty" for ITV companies and "Cloud Burst", "The Boy from Space", and "The King's Dragon" as part of BBC's "Look and Read" (1967 2004) programme for schools, some episodes of which he also presented. In the 1980s came the historical adventures "Smuggler" and its later antipodean-based follow-up "Adventurer", and between them, the lavish HTV production "Robin of Sherwood", which ran for three series. Carpenter then worked on a number of series for children and families in the 1990s ("The Winjin' Pom", "Stanley's Dragon", and "Out of Sight"), some of which ("The Borrowers", "The Return of the Borrowers", and "The Scarlet Pimpernel") were based on classic novels. Carpenter wrote novelisations of many of the early series he created "Catweazle", "Cloud Burst", "The Ghosts of Motley Hall", "Smuggler", "Robin of Sherwood" (two books), and two books of "Dick Turpin". Carpenter died from a pulmonary embolism on 26 February 2012 at the age of 82.
