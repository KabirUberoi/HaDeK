%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Sous-lieutenant Paul Yvan Robert Waddington was a French World War I flying ace credited with twelve aerial victories. Waddington joined the 141e Regiment d'Infanterie on 15 December 1914 as a soldat de 2e classe. He was promoted to corporal on 21 June 1915 exactly a month later, he was forwarded to the 2e Groupe d'Aviation. On 27 September, he was assigned to Escadrille 67. He was promoted to sergeant while with this unit, on 11 March 1916. Waddington reported for pilot's training at Buc on 3 September 1916. He was awarded military pilot's brevet no. 5254 on 26 January 1917, and forwarded for advanced training at Avord, and then Pau. He was then posted as a pilot with Escadrille N12 (the "N" denoting the unit's use of Nieuports) on 28 March 1917. He teamed with Alfred Auger and Joseph M. X. de Sévin for his first victory on 11 May 1917. A promotion to adjutant followed on 20 July 1917, with a further promotion to sous-lieutenant on 25 January 1918. He transferred to Escadrille SPA154 (which operated SPADs) on 6 March 1918. Between 12 April and 22 August 1918, he ran off a string of five victories each over enemy airplanes and observation balloons, with all but one of the wins being shared with such fellow French aces as Xavier Moissinac, Paul Barbreau, Louis Prosper Gros, Michel Coiffard, Jacques Ehrlich, and balloon buster Théophile Condémine. On 19 September 1918, he was transferred to his final wartime post, with Escadrille SPA31. He scored his final triumph solo ten days later. On 9 November 1918, he was awarded the "Légion d'Honneur" to accompany his prior awards of the "Croix de Guerre" with five "palmes", one "étoile de vermeil", one "étoile d'argent", and another "étoile de bronze". He had also won a Belgian "Croix de Guerre" and a Serbian decoration. Waddington would later rise to lieutenant colonel and command a school for fighter pilots before World War II.
