Sentences : 

Heinz Christian Pander (1794 1865) was a German anatomist and embryologist who was born in Riga, Latvia.
He studied medicine at the University of Dorpat and later at the University of Berlin.
He was a professor of anatomy at the University of Dorpat from 1820 to 1845.
Pander is best known for his work on the development of chick embryos, which he described in his 1817 book Beiträge zur Entwickelungsgeschichte des Hühnereies (Contributions to the Developmental History of the Chicken Egg).
He was the first to describe the three germ layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, and he was the first to describe the notochord.
He also described the development of the neural tube, the formation of the amniotic cavity, and the development of the heart and blood vessels.
He was the first to describe the process of gastrulation in chick embryos.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Heinz Christian Pander (24 July 1794 22 September 1865), also known as Christian Heinrich Pander, was a Baltic German biologist and embryologist born in Riga. In 1817, he received his doctorate from the University of Würzburg, and spent several years (1827 1842) performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga). In 1820, he took part in a scientific expedition to Bokhara as a naturalist. In 1826, he became a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Pander studied the chick embryo and discovered the germ layers (i.e., three distinct regions of the embryo that give rise to the specific organ system). Because of these findings, he is considered by many to be the "founder of embryology". His work in embryology was continued by Karl Ernst von Baer (1792 1876), who expanded Pander's concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates. Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective "Panderian", first used by the Canadian palaeontologist Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts. Today, the Pander Society is an international association of palaeontologists and stratigraphers with a common interest in the study of conodonts. He died in Saint Petersburg.
