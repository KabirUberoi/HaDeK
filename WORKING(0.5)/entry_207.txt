%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Thomas Biagi is a professional racecar driver from Italy. He was born in Bologna on 7 May 1976. Biagi started his career in single seaters, driving in the Formula Alfa Boxer and Italian Formula Three Championship, where he was the fifth best in 1995, with two wins. From there, he moved up to the FIA Formula 3000 Championship from 1995 to 1998, without major results. His debut race in 1995 saw him collide with Marco Campos on the last lap, resulting in a crash which inflicted fatal injuries on the Brazilian driver. Biagi switched to the "second division", the Italian F3000 Championship, in 1999, taking fourth place, which he repeated in 2000 (after the series had become Euro F3000), this time with a win, before taking second overall in 2001, in his second season with GP Racing. In 2003, Thomas Biagi made a successful move to the FIA GT Championship, which he won in a BMS Scuderia Italia Ferrari 550 Maranello (co-driven with Matteo Bobbi). After a year in the Le Mans Endurance Series, he returned to the FIA GT with Vitaphone Racing, helping the squad take two team titles before winning the drivers' title himself in 2007. In spite of having won the drivers' title in the GT1 class, Biagi downgraded to GT2 in 2008, to drive a Ferrari 430 for AF Corse.
