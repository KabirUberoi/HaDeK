Kirill Karabits (born 26 December 1976, in Kiev in the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union) is a Ukrainian conductor. His father was the conductor and composer Ivan Karabyts. In his youth, Karabits studied piano, and developed an interest in conducting at age 13. His early teachers included Tatiana Kozlov. In Kiev, he studied at the Lysenko Music School, and later at the National Tchaikovsky Music Academy. In 1995, he began studies at the Vienna Musikhochschule and earned a diploma in orchestral conducting after five years of study. He also attended the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart, where he was a pupil of Helmuth Rilling and Peter Gulke.

Karabits made his first public conducting appearance at age 19. He was assistant conductor of the Budapest Festival Orchestra from 1998 to 2000. He also served as associate conductor of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France from 2002 to 2005.
