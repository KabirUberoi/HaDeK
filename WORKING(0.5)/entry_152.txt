%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Sir Josiah Mason (23 February 1795 - 16 June 1881) was an English industrialist, engaged in pen manufacture and other trades, and a philanthropist. He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham. He was the son of a carpet-weaver and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits, and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentry, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. There he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824, he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. In 1874, the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about 300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880, Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about 250,000.
