%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Riccardo Tisci (born 1974 in Taranto, Italy) is an Italian fashion designer. He studied in Italy at the Design Istituto d'Arte Applicata in Cantu until the age of 17, and then graduated from London's Central Saint Martins Academy in 1999. In 2005, Tisci was named Creative Director for Givenchy women's haute couture and ready-to-wear lines. In May 2008, he was additionally named as menswear and accessories designer of the Givenchy men's division. Tisci's apparent fascination with gothic touches (dark, languid dresses for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting around a sterile-white sphere) has drawn new attention to the Givenchy brand. Reviews and output so far have been mixed and inconsistent, but many, including influential fashion critics (such as Cathy Horyn of The New York Times and Suzy Menkes of The International Herald Tribune) have homed in on Tisci's conceptual leanings, as well as his future potential for revitalizing the Givenchy brand and infusing it with his precision and imagination.
