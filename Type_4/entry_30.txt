Ground Truth : 

Steven Charles Threet (born January 2, 1989) is a former American football quarterback who played for both Michigan and Arizona State. After finishing his playing career, he became a student assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff. He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season, Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010. He threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007. After the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games. Later that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro-style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach Dennis Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.
