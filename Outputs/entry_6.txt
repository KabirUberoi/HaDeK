%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 
Mahamarakkala Patabendige Akila Dananjaya Perera born 4 October 1993 in Panadura, Western Province is a Sri Lankan cricketer. The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lankas long line of unorthodox spinners. Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra, and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20, or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly, and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2013 IPL auctions, Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of 20,000.
