Ground Truth : 

Yaakov Israel Ifargan (born 1966), also known as the X-Ray (Hebrew Ha-Rentgen), is an Israeli Kabbalist rabbi and spiritual adviser who operates in Netivot, a town in southern Israel. He is known among his followers for his supposed healing and prognostic powers. Ifargan's admirers include a mix of low-income Mizrahi Jewish people from southern Israel, as well as high-profile Israeli politicians, businessmen, and celebrities. Ifargan also has a following among a group of Breslov Hasidim. Ifargan is the son of Shalom Ifargan (Baba Shalom), and he transformed his father's tomb in Netivot into an ultramodern, pyramid-shaped mausoleum, where he conducts an annual gala event and holds his midnight tikkun (reparation) ceremonies. Ifargan provides blessings and business advice to some of Israel's most prominent businessmen and politicians for a fee, and adherents believe he has the ability to diagnose patients by eyesight only. Others claim he is a charlatan who has grown into a multimillionaire from selling amulets and from other illicit businesses. He is one of the wealthiest rabbis in Israel, with an estimated net worth of 23 million as of 2012. One of the foremost followers of the rabbi is Nochi Dankner, a leading Israeli businessman, who has donated hundreds of thousands of Israeli shekels to the rabbi's causes. A 2001 report by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth claimed that most of the sums donated are not made known to the Israeli tax authorities, although this is denied by Ifargan.
