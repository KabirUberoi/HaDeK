Don R. Swanson (October 10, 1924 - November 18, 2012) was an American information scientist, most known for his work in literature-based discovery in the biomedical domain. His particular method has been used as a model for further work, and is often referred to as Swanson linking. He was an investigator in the Arrowsmith System Project, which seeks to determine meaningful links between MEDLINE articles to identify previously undiscovered public knowledge. He had been Professor Emeritus of the University of Chicago since 1996, and remained active in a post-retirement appointment until his health began to decline in 2009. Swanson received his B.S. in Physics at Caltech, Pasadena, California in 1945, followed by an M.A. at Rice Institute, Houston, Texas, two years later, and then a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1952. He worked as a physicist at various laboratories until 1963, when he was made a professor and served as Dean of the Graduate School of Library Science at the University of Chicago until 1972 and again from 1977-79 and 1987-89. In 2000, he was awarded the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor of the society, for his "lifetime achievements in research and scholarship."
