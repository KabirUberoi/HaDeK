Ground Truth : 

Torrance Heather "Torry" Castellano (born January 8, 1979, in San Francisco, California) is the former drummer of The Donnas, announcing her retirement in July 2010. She is the cousin of actress Laura San Giacomo. Early in her childhood, she moved to Palo Alto, California, where she met her bandmates. She was asked to be part of the band by Allison Robertson, and agreed even though she did not have any experience. The band rehearsed every day in her garage. Before the release of The Donnas' album "Gold Medal", Castellano developed tendonitis. In October 2003, she had surgery for it. During her recovery, she had to take drum lessons to re-learn to hold drumsticks the correct way. For "Gold Medal", she recorded with her recovering wrists, but could only play for short periods of time. A shoulder problem forced Castellano to withdraw from The Donnas' tour following a show on December 27, 2008, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA. Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics filled in on future tour dates. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced on the band's website that due to her shoulder she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. Castellano still attended events the band was involved with as well as promoted the last album she recorded with the band, "Greatest Hits Volume 16". She attended Santa Monica College before transferring to Stanford University, where she was in the Class of 2013 and majored in Political Science. Castellano graduated from Stanford with distinction and will attend Harvard Law School starting in the fall of 2013.
