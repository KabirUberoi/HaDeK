Frankie Lymon (September 30, 1942 February 27, 1968) was an American rock and roll rhythm and blues singer and songwriter, best known as the lead singer of the New York City-based early rock and roll group The Teenagers. Lymon was one of the first African-American teenagers to be widely accepted as a teen idol. He was noted for his high-pitched voice and his ability to sing in a "whining" style. His group, The Teenagers, was composed of five boys, all of whom were in their mid-teens. The group had a number of hit singles, including "Why Do Fools Fall in Love", which was Lymon's biggest hit and one of the biggest hits of the rock and roll era. Lymon's success as a singer and a performer was short-lived, however, as he struggled with drug addiction and personal problems. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 25.
