%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GROUND_TRUTH%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ground Truth : 

Irena Sendler née Krzyżanowska, also referred to as Irena Sendlerowa in Poland, nom de guerre Jolanta 15 February 1910 12 May 2008 , was a Polish nurse and social worker who served in the Polish Underground in German-occupied Warsaw during World War II, and was head of the children s section of Żegota, the Polish Council to Aid Jews, which was active from 1942 to 1945. Assisted by some two dozen other Żegota members, Sendler smuggled approximately 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then provided them with false identity documents and shelter outside the ghetto, saving those children from the Holocaust. With the exception of diplomats who issued visas to help Jews flee Nazi-occupied Europe, Sendler saved more Jews than any other individual during the Holocaust. The German occupiers eventually discovered her activities and she was arrested by the Gestapo, tortured, and sentenced to death, but she managed to evade execution and survive the war. In 1965, Sendler was recognised by the State of Israel as Righteous Among the Nations. Late in life she was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland s highest honor, for her wartime humanitarian efforts.
